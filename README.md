Benchmarks for Bachelor thesis
==============================

This repository contains benchmarks for my Bachelor thesis. Most benchmarks for
the thesis come from the [SV-COMP benchmark
set](https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks), but some additional are
necessary, as well as some changed benchmarks.

Array examples
--------------

The files in directory `array-examples` are taken from the SV-COMP benchmark
set. We noticed during testing, that the sizes of the arrays-reach set of
SV-COMP is still to big, hence we reduced them in various steps. All of these
files are licensed by Apache 2.0 license.
